# Testing-the-tenets-of-climate-smart-agriculture-with-archaeological-records
This repository provides the data and simple code necessary to conduct an analysis of the sensitivity of radiocarbon records in six case studies.

This data and code deposition contains two files for reanalyzing the results of: ``Testing the tenets of climate-smart agriculture with archaeological records" by Freeman et al. December 2019.

(1) Radiocarbon zip file.  This file contains all of the raw radiocaron data for the case studies in the paper and all of the code for constructing SPDs for each case study.

(2) Analysis zip file. This file contains all of the processes data that we used to conduct our analysis. The file also contains simple code for replicating the analysis.
